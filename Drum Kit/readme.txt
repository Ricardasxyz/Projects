This is a tutorial based project, where I was learning more about JS. 

How it works: when you click a key on the keyboard or on the screen it triggers an event and gives a sound as well as puts a style on the image. 

Things I have learned here: 

1. More about methods
2. Higher order functions 
3. Objects 
4. Callbacks 
5. this 
6. collections
